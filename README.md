# Analyzing 10Gb of Yelp Reviews Data

In this project, I analysed a subset of Yelp's business, review and user data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). I leveraged the analysis on AWS EMR and used the following three S3 buckets to pull the data:
s3://sta-9760-spark-datasets/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
s3://sta-9760-spark-datasets/yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
s3://sta-9760-spark-datasets/yelp_academic_dataset_user.json

## Analysis

The analysis divided into four parts, including initial setup, categories analysis, compared the overall business rating, and an analysis of how top users on Yelp influence the business rating.
